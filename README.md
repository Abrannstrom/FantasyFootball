## What Works
  It's clear that the elite RBs have access to a ceiling that we can't find anywhere else (Cooper Kupp lol).  Despite Jonathon Taylor being a first round pick in most drafts in 2021 he provided a whopping 43% advance rate which rivals Cooper Kupp's 48%.  I think it's fair to say that Kupp had a legendary season and considering his adp being at the 3/4 turn, you would expect his advance rate to be higher than it was.

  Philosophically, I'm more inclined to take hammer WR's and TE's in the first couple of rounds because health is the biggest factor in whether or not these elite guys are able to return value on that investment.  But, with Underdog scoring being half-ppr, the legendary upside is going to favor the elite RBs a lot more than DraftKings would where they use full-ppr.  With how much variance is involved in this game that we play I believe that it's going to take several years for us to gather enough data to really nail down what works.  In the meantime, let's try to get ahead of the curve so we can take down the $2 million up top.   
## What Will Work in 2022
  I won't go in depth about the different kinds of strategies for now. I assume if you're reading this in May then you are a sicko like myself.  The strategy that I heavily prefer as of 5/16 is anchor RB in which I take my first RB in the 3rd round.  Here are the RBs that I LOVE in the third round: Leonard Fournette, James Conner and    
Aaron Jones.  Sometimes these guys will be gone by the middle of the 3rd in which case I would push it to the 4th round where you can reliably get Hall. Do you think that their ceiling outcomes are all that different from guys like Dalvin or Najee who are going in the first round!? I don't think so. I think I prefer Fournette over Cook straight up because, as I said, the most important thing about these volume hogs is can they stay healthy for most of the year.
  
  Furthermore, this 3rd round anchor RB is my preferred strategy also because of the significant drop off of WR quality after the 2nd round.  After WR11 Tee Higgins at an adp of 25 we have Keenan Allen. Don't get me wrong I love the guy, but Allen just isn't capable of giving us the spike weeks that we need if we're trying to bink these large field tournaments.  As of right now I believe there are 4 WRs that are worthy of a first round pick: Kupp, Jefferson, Chase and Diggs.  Even if you're drafting out of the 12 hole you can still get Diggs a chunk of the time and, if not, I like starting Lamb + Kelce. 
  
  My first BBM3 draft started like this out of the 4 hole: Justin Jefferson, Tyreek Hill, Nick Chubb. Chubb slid 10 picks past adp to me at 28 which was a gift because I don't see how I'm ever going to draft him at adp. I would've loved to take Aaron Jones, who was available to me at 3.04, anyway had Chubb not fallen to me. For the first two BBM's, there have been two high-end RBs that have been the skeleton keys to winning these massive tournaments. In, 2020 it was Kamara and Cook. In 2021, it was JT and Ekeler.  Who is to say it won't be guys like Fournette and Jones this year.
  
  I'm going anchor RB and if I have the 1.01 that anchor is JT, otherwise, I'm starting with two receivers.
  
## Player Targets
  Let me start by saying that I think the ADPs on Underdog are very efficient.  As I started to dig into the numbers, I found that the ADPs are very closely correlated to the number of fantasy points that players scored in the previous year.  In some cases, it seems the field neglects to consider how large of a factor variance is in this game that we play. Below are a couple of players that underperformed against expectation based on opportunities in 2021.    

### RB David Montgomery – CHI (ADP: 47.4)
  I understand the lack of excitement that comes with drafting Bears players but Montgomery is a volume monster.  He averaged 21.5 touches per game (3.5 receptions) in his final 10 games last season, trailing only Jonathon Taylor and Dalvin Cook.  Although he was very inefficient based on that usage, he was still the RB12 over that stretch in half ppr scoring.  Montgomery is being drafted as the RB18 on Underdog right now.  Need I remind everyone that he saw a very similar workload in 2020 and was the RB4 of the season.  I believe Montgomery is being drafted beneath his floor outcome and he still has the upside to help us win BBM3.  

### TE Zach Ertz – ARI (ADP: 110.3)
  Listen, I dislike old and dusty TE’s just as much as the next guy but Ertz is too cheap.  He was the TE5 in terms of target volume during his time in Arizona last year and posted a modest TE9 half ppr average. Over the final 4 games of 2021, he averaged 10.75 targets per game trailing only Mark Andrews.  And although he saw an uptick in opportunities in those games, he didn’t reap the benefits of the accompanying uptick in production that is supposed to follow.  Kyler Murray’s two favorite targets last year were Christian Kirk and DeAndre Hopkins, one of which is no longer on the team and the other is going to miss the first 6 games of 2022.  Ertz is being drafted as the TE10 and 70 picks behind Darren Waller, a player that I believe Ertz is likely to out target.  I’m comfortable rolling Ertz out as my TE1 on Underdog in 2 TE builds.  The structural advantage that this provides for roster building is even more valuable than the raw ADP misevaluation.
